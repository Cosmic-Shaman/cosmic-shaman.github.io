# Contributing to The Quantum GR Regulation Method Blueprint

This repository hosts a conceptual blueprint for **The Quantum GR Regulation Method**, focused on sparking new perspectives on AI memory and contextual coherence.

Currently, this repository is intended primarily as an **open-access read-only resource** for exploration, understanding, and independent reflection on this foundational framework. We aim to share these ideas for the broader AI/ML community to review and consider.

While we are not actively seeking code contributions, pull requests, or feature requests through this repository's issues at this time, we deeply value intellectual engagement and thoughtful discussion on the underlying concepts.

Should you wish to engage with the ideas or provide feedback, please consider joining the discussions on relevant public forums (such as `r/MachineLearning` or `r/ArtificialIntelligence`) where this blueprint is shared.

Thank you for exploring this conceptual framework.
